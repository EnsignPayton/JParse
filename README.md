# JParse

A JSON parser, and yet another chapter in my journey to understanding Aho and Ullman's dragon books.

## TODOs

* Generic type conversion - think Newtonsoft's `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>`.
* Optimization - I haven't profiled, but it's probably orders of magnitude slower than it should be.
* Functional - Rewrite in F#. Compare/contrast to original.
* Public Interface - Write a public interface to the core library that can be called from anywhere.
* Publish - If this gets anywhere close to useful, consider publishing to Nuget just to say you did.
